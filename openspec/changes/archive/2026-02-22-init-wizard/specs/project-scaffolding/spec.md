## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Wizard-based scaffolder
`create_lexibrary_from_wizard(project_root: Path, answers: WizardAnswers) -> list[Path]` SHALL create the `.lexibrary/` skeleton using wizard answers. It SHALL return a list of all created file paths.

The function SHALL create:
- `.lexibrary/` directory
- `.lexibrary/concepts/` directory with `.gitkeep`
- `.lexibrary/stack/` directory with `.gitkeep`
- `.lexibrary/config.yaml` generated dynamically from `answers`
- `.lexibrary/START_HERE.md` placeholder
- `.lexignore` with wizard-provided ignore patterns

The function SHALL NOT create `HANDOFF.md`.

#### Scenario: Creates directory structure
- **WHEN** `create_lexibrary_from_wizard()` is called with valid answers
- **THEN** `.lexibrary/`, `.lexibrary/concepts/`, and `.lexibrary/stack/` SHALL exist

#### Scenario: Creates config from answers
- **WHEN** answers has `project_name="my-app"` and `llm_provider="anthropic"`
- **THEN** `.lexibrary/config.yaml` SHALL contain `project_name: my-app` and `provider: anthropic`

#### Scenario: Does NOT create HANDOFF.md
- **WHEN** `create_lexibrary_from_wizard()` is called
- **THEN** `.lexibrary/HANDOFF.md` SHALL NOT exist

#### Scenario: Creates .lexignore with patterns
- **WHEN** answers has `ignore_patterns=["dist/", "build/"]`
- **THEN** `.lexignore` SHALL contain those patterns

#### Scenario: Creates .lexignore empty when no patterns
- **WHEN** answers has `ignore_patterns=[]`
- **THEN** `.lexignore` SHALL exist with a header comment but no patterns

#### Scenario: Returns list of created paths
- **WHEN** `create_lexibrary_from_wizard()` completes
- **THEN** the returned list SHALL contain all created file paths

### Requirement: Dynamic config generation
`_generate_config_yaml(answers: WizardAnswers) -> str` SHALL build a config dict from answers, validate it through `LexibraryConfig.model_validate()`, and serialize to YAML with `sort_keys=False`. The output SHALL include a header comment indicating it was generated by `lexictl init`.

#### Scenario: Generated config is valid
- **WHEN** `_generate_config_yaml()` is called with valid answers
- **THEN** the output SHALL be valid YAML that loads into a `LexibraryConfig` without errors

#### Scenario: Config includes all wizard fields
- **WHEN** answers has `project_name`, `scope_root`, `agent_environments`, LLM settings, and IWH setting
- **THEN** the generated YAML SHALL include all of these fields

#### Scenario: Custom token budgets included
- **WHEN** `answers.token_budgets_customized` is `True` and `answers.token_budgets` has values
- **THEN** the generated YAML SHALL include a `token_budgets` section with those values

#### Scenario: Default token budgets omitted
- **WHEN** `answers.token_budgets_customized` is `False`
- **THEN** the generated YAML SHALL NOT include a `token_budgets` section (defaults apply)

#### Scenario: Config validated before write
- **WHEN** `_generate_config_yaml()` is called with invalid data
- **THEN** a `ValidationError` SHALL be raised before any YAML output is produced

### Requirement: Lexignore generation
The scaffolder SHALL generate a `.lexignore` file with a header comment and any ignore patterns from the wizard answers, in gitignore format.

#### Scenario: Lexignore with patterns
- **WHEN** wizard answers include `ignore_patterns=["dist/", "coverage/"]`
- **THEN** `.lexignore` SHALL contain `dist/` and `coverage/` as patterns

#### Scenario: Lexignore with header
- **WHEN** `.lexignore` is generated
- **THEN** the file SHALL start with a comment header explaining its purpose

### Requirement: Original scaffolder preserved
`create_lexibrary_skeleton()` SHALL remain unchanged and continue to work as before. The wizard-based scaffolder is additive.

#### Scenario: Old scaffolder still works
- **WHEN** `create_lexibrary_skeleton(project_root)` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL create the same structure as before (including HANDOFF.md)

### Requirement: Wizard scaffolder exported from init package
`create_lexibrary_from_wizard` SHALL be importable from `lexibrarian.init`.

#### Scenario: Import create_lexibrary_from_wizard
- **WHEN** running `from lexibrarian.init import create_lexibrary_from_wizard`
- **THEN** the import SHALL succeed
