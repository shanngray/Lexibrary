## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: generate_start_here function
The system SHALL provide `async generate_start_here(project_root, config, archivist) -> Path` in `src/lexibrarian/archivist/start_here.py` that generates or updates `.lexibrary/START_HERE.md` from project topology and `.aindex` summaries.

The pipeline SHALL:
1. Build directory tree string (exclude `.lexibrary/`, ignored dirs)
2. Collect billboard summaries from all `.aindex` files in the mirror tree
3. Read existing `START_HERE.md` if it exists (for continuity)
4. Call `archivist.generate_start_here()`
5. Assemble final markdown from StartHereOutput sections
6. Validate against token budget (`start_here_tokens`)
7. Write to `.lexibrary/START_HERE.md`

#### Scenario: Generate START_HERE for project
- **WHEN** `generate_start_here()` is called
- **THEN** `.lexibrary/START_HERE.md` SHALL be written with topology, ontology, navigation, conventions, and protocol sections

#### Scenario: Collects .aindex summaries
- **WHEN** `generate_start_here()` builds input for the LLM
- **THEN** it SHALL read billboard text from each `.aindex` in the mirror tree

#### Scenario: Excludes .lexibrary directory from tree
- **WHEN** `generate_start_here()` builds the directory tree
- **THEN** the `.lexibrary/` directory SHALL NOT appear in the tree string

#### Scenario: Token budget warning
- **WHEN** the generated START_HERE.md exceeds `start_here_tokens` budget
- **THEN** a warning SHALL be logged

### Requirement: START_HERE.md regeneration triggers
`START_HERE.md` SHALL be regenerated when:
- `lexi update` runs without a specific path (full project update)
- The set of top-level directories has changed since last generation

`START_HERE.md` SHALL NOT be regenerated on every single file update.

#### Scenario: Full project update regenerates START_HERE
- **WHEN** `lexi update` runs with no path argument
- **THEN** `START_HERE.md` SHALL be regenerated after all file updates

#### Scenario: Single file update skips START_HERE
- **WHEN** `lexi update src/foo.py` runs (single file)
- **THEN** `START_HERE.md` SHALL NOT be regenerated

### Requirement: HANDOFF.md not generated by Archivist
The Archivist SHALL NOT generate or modify `HANDOFF.md`. It is written exclusively by agents during their sessions. `lexi init` creates a placeholder only.

#### Scenario: Archivist leaves HANDOFF alone
- **WHEN** `update_project()` runs
- **THEN** `HANDOFF.md` SHALL NOT be created or modified by the Archivist pipeline
