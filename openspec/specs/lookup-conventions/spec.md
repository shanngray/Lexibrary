# lookup-conventions Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change validation-status. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Lookup appends inherited Local Conventions
The `lexi lookup <file>` command SHALL, after displaying the design file content, walk upward from the file's parent directory to `scope_root` (inclusive), parsing each `.aindex` file for `local_conventions`. If any conventions are found, an `## Applicable Conventions` section SHALL be appended to the output.

#### Scenario: File in directory with conventions
- **WHEN** running `lexi lookup src/payments/processor.py` and `src/payments/.aindex` has Local Conventions ["All monetary values use Decimal"]
- **THEN** the output includes an "## Applicable Conventions" section with "From `src/payments/`:" and the convention text

#### Scenario: File inherits conventions from multiple parent directories
- **WHEN** running `lexi lookup src/payments/stripe/charge.py` and both `src/.aindex` has conventions ["Use UTC everywhere"] and `src/payments/.aindex` has conventions ["Use Decimal for money"]
- **THEN** the output shows conventions from both directories, with closest directory first

#### Scenario: File with no applicable conventions
- **WHEN** running `lexi lookup src/utils/helpers.py` and no parent `.aindex` files have Local Conventions
- **THEN** no "## Applicable Conventions" section is appended (output is unchanged from current behavior)

### Requirement: Convention inheritance stops at scope_root
The convention walk SHALL NOT traverse above the configured `scope_root` directory. This ensures conventions from unrelated parent directories are not surfaced.

#### Scenario: Walk stops at scope_root boundary
- **WHEN** `scope_root` is configured as `src/` and the file is `src/api/auth.py`
- **THEN** the walk checks `src/api/.aindex` and `src/.aindex` but does NOT check the project root `.aindex`

### Requirement: Convention display format groups by source directory
Conventions SHALL be displayed grouped by their source directory, with the directory path as a header. Directories SHALL be ordered from closest (most specific) to farthest (most general).

#### Scenario: Conventions grouped by directory
- **WHEN** conventions are found from `src/payments/` and `src/`
- **THEN** output shows `**From \`src/payments/\`:**` with its conventions first, then `**From \`src/\`:**` with its conventions

### Requirement: Missing aindex files are silently skipped
If a parent directory does not have a corresponding `.aindex` file, the convention walk SHALL skip that directory without error and continue walking upward.

#### Scenario: Parent without aindex is skipped
- **WHEN** walking from `src/payments/stripe/` and `src/payments/stripe/.aindex` does not exist
- **THEN** the walk skips that directory and checks `src/payments/.aindex` and `src/.aindex`
