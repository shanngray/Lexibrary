### Requirement: Add answer to post
The system SHALL provide an `add_answer(post_path: Path, author: str, body: str) -> StackPost` function in `src/lexibrarian/stack/mutations.py` that:
- Parses the existing post from disk
- Appends a new `StackAnswer` with the next answer number, today's date, the given author and body
- Re-serializes and writes the post back to disk
- Returns the updated `StackPost`

#### Scenario: Add first answer
- **WHEN** `add_answer()` is called on a post with no existing answers
- **THEN** the new answer SHALL be `A1` with `number=1`

#### Scenario: Add second answer
- **WHEN** `add_answer()` is called on a post that already has `A1`
- **THEN** the new answer SHALL be `A2` with `number=2`

#### Scenario: Existing answers preserved
- **WHEN** `add_answer()` is called on a post with existing answers

The system SHALL provide a `record_vote(post_path: Path, target: str, direction: str, author: str, comment: str | None = None) -> StackPost` function that:
- `target` is `"post"` or `"A{n}"` (e.g., `"A1"`, `"A2"`)
- `direction` is `"up"` or `"down"`
- For `target="post"`: increments/decrements the post's `votes` field in frontmatter
- For `target="A{n}"`: increments/decrements the answer's `votes` field
- If `comment` is provided, appends a comment line with `[upvote]` or `[downvote]` context

#### Scenario: Downvote answer appends comment
- **WHEN** `record_vote(path, "A2", "down", "agent-123", comment="Doesn't work")` is called

#### Scenario: Accept answer marks resolved
