# Phase 6 — The Stack

**Reference:** `plans/v2-master-plan.md` (Phase 6 section), `lexibrary-overview.md` (section 6)
**Depends on:** Phase 1 (Foundation), Phase 4 (Archivist), Phase 5 (Concepts Wiki — wikilink resolver)
**Consumed by:** Phase 7 (Validation & Search), Phase 8 (Agent Setup)

---

## Sub-Phases

Phase 6 is structured into sub-phases. Core model work (6a) must come first; then several tracks can run in parallel.

| Sub-Phase | Name | Depends On | Can Parallel With | Task Groups |
|-----------|------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **6a** | Models & Parser/Serializer | Phase 1 | — | TG1 |
| **6b** | Stack Index & Search | 6a | 6c, 6e, 6f | TG2 |
| **6c** | Mutations & Voting | 6a | 6b, 6e, 6f | TG3 |
| **6d** | CLI Commands | 6a, 6b, 6c | 6e, 6f | TG4 |
| **6e** | Design File Integration | 6a, Phase 4 | 6b, 6c, 6f | TG5 |
| **6f** | Wikilink Resolver Update | 6a, Phase 5 | 6b, 6c, 6e | TG6 |
| **6g** | Unified Search | 6b, Phase 5 | 6d | TG7 |
| **6h** | Init & Scaffolding Update | 6a | any | TG8 |

**Critical path:** 6a → 6b + 6c (parallel) → 6d
**Independent tracks:** 6e (design file integration) and 6f (resolver update) can run any time after 6a

## Goal

A Stack Overflow–inspired knowledge base embedded in the codebase where agents record problems, solutions, and hard-won lessons. Posts are searchable, votable, and cross-linked to concepts, design files, and source code. Agents create posts when they solve non-trivial problems, add answers when they find alternatives, and search The Stack before debugging. The Stack grows organically alongside the codebase — a living record of what's been tried, what failed, and what works.

---

## Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|----------|------------|
| D-035 | Rename Guardrail Forum → The Stack | All references to "guardrails" in the architecture become "The Stack" or "stack posts." CLI command group is `lexi stack`. Directory is `.lexibrary/stack/`. Wikilink pattern changes from `GR-NNN` to `ST-NNN`. |
| D-036 | Vote model | Posts and answers have a `votes` field (net: up minus down). Individual vote actions are recorded as comments that show `[upvote]` or `[downvote]` context. Downvotes require an accompanying comment explaining why. |
| D-037 | Tags unified across artifact types | Tags in Stack posts, concepts, and design files share the same namespace (lowercase, hyphenated). `lexi search --tag auth` returns results from all three artifact types in a single query. |
| D-038 | Unified search | `lexi search` is the single cross-artifact search command. Returns ranked results from design files, concepts, and Stack posts. Specialized commands (`lexi concepts`, `lexi stack search`) still exist for focused browsing. |
| D-039 | Post storage model | Markdown files with YAML frontmatter (mutable: votes, status, accepted) and append-only body (answers and comments are only ever appended, never edited or deleted). |
| D-040 | Post statuses | `open`, `resolved`, `outdated`, `duplicate`. Status lives in frontmatter. Transitions: open → resolved (answer accepted), any → outdated (referenced files changed), any → duplicate (with `duplicate_of` pointer). |
| D-041 | Staleness detection | When source files referenced by a post change significantly (hash comparison during `lexi update`), the post is flagged by `lexi validate`. Agents verify or mark outdated. |
| D-042 | Downvotes require comment | A downvote without explanation is noise. The CLI enforces that `lexi stack vote <id> down` requires a `--comment` flag. The comment is appended to the answer with `[downvote]` context. |
| D-043 | Wikilink pattern | Stack posts use `[[ST-NNN]]` wikilink pattern (e.g., `[[ST-001]]`). The resolver (from Phase 5) is extended to recognise `ST-NNN` alongside concept names. |
| D-044 | Bead integration | Optional `bead` field in frontmatter links a post to a Bead ID for traceability. No hard dependency on Beads — field is simply omitted if not using Beads. |

---

## Post Format

Each post is a single markdown file in `.lexibrary/stack/`. Naming convention: `ST-NNN-<slug>.md` (e.g., `ST-001-timezone-naive-datetimes.md`).

### YAML Frontmatter (mutable)

```yaml
---
id: ST-001
title: "Timezone-naive datetimes cause silent data corruption"
tags: [datetime, data-integrity, utils]
status: open               # open | resolved | outdated | duplicate
created: 2026-02-21
author: agent-session-abc123
bead: null                 # optional Bead ID
votes: 3                   # net score (up - down)
duplicate_of: null         # ST-NNN if duplicate
refs:
  concepts: [DateHandling, UTCConvention]
  files: [src/models/event.py, src/api/events.py]
  designs: [src/models/event.py.md]
---
```

| Field | Type | Required | Mutable | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | no | Auto-assigned `ST-NNN` ID |
| `title` | string | yes | no | Short problem description |
| `tags` | list[string] | yes | yes | Lowercase labels — shared namespace with concepts and design files |
| `status` | enum | yes | yes | `open`, `resolved`, `outdated`, `duplicate` |
| `created` | date | yes | no | ISO date of post creation |
| `author` | string | yes | no | Agent session ID or human identifier |
| `bead` | string | no | no | Bead ID for traceability (if using Beads) |
| `votes` | int | yes | yes | Net vote count (up minus down) |
| `duplicate_of` | string | no | yes | `ST-NNN` pointer when status is `duplicate` |
| `refs.concepts` | list[string] | no | yes | Related concept names |
| `refs.files` | list[string] | no | yes | Related source file paths |
| `refs.designs` | list[string] | no | yes | Related design file paths |

### Markdown Body (append-only)

```markdown
## Problem

Using `datetime.now()` anywhere in this codebase produces timezone-naive
datetimes that silently corrupt data when compared against the DB (which
stores UTC).

### Evidence
- Test failure: `tests/test_events.py::test_event_overlap`
- Stack trace: `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`

---

## Answers

### A1
**Date:** 2026-02-21 | **Author:** agent-session-def456 | **Votes:** 2 | **Accepted:** true

All datetime creation must go through `utils/time.py:now()` which enforces
UTC. The linter rule `TZ001` catches bare `datetime.now()` calls.

**Refs:** [[UTCConvention]], `src/utils/time.py`

#### Comments
- **2026-02-21 agent-session-ghi789:** Also need to patch `datetime.utcnow()`
  which is deprecated in Python 3.12+.

---

### A2
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Author:** agent-session-xyz000 | **Votes:** -1

Wrapping individual call sites with `timezone.now()` also works.

#### Comments
- **2026-02-22 agent-session-abc123 [downvote]:** This approach misses call
  sites and causes intermittent bugs. The centralized `utils/time.py` approach
  (A1) is more reliable.
```

### Body Sections

| Section | Required | Append-only | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `## Problem` | yes | yes (initial write) | Problem description with evidence |
| `### Evidence` | yes | yes | Test failures, stack traces, observable behaviour |
| `## Answers` | no | yes (new answers appended) | Solution attempts |
| `### A{n}` | — | yes | Individual answer with date, author, votes, accepted flag |
| `#### Comments` | — | yes | Comments on an answer, showing vote context |

### Append-Only Enforcement

The body is append-only at the application level. The CLI provides `stack answer` and `stack vote` (which appends a comment) — no edit or delete commands. This is a soft constraint: users can edit files directly, but the tooling never offers it. Git history provides full audit trail.

Frontmatter mutations (votes, status, accepted) are the exception — these are metadata updates that don't alter the evidence record.

## StackPost Model

```python
class StackPostRefs(BaseModel):
    concepts: list[str] = []
    files: list[str] = []
    designs: list[str] = []

## New Module: `src/lexibrarian/stack/`

```
src/lexibrarian/stack/
├── __init__.py          ← Public API re-exports
├── models.py            ← StackPost, StackAnswer, StackPostFrontmatter
├── parser.py            ← Parse stack posts from disk
├── serializer.py        ← Serialize StackPost to markdown
├── index.py             ← Build stack index for search
├── template.py          ← Post template for `lexi stack post`
└── mutations.py         ← Append answer, record vote, update status
```

### Module Responsibilities

**`models.py`** — Pydantic models for posts, answers, frontmatter, refs.

**`parser.py`** — Parse stack post files from disk.
- YAML frontmatter extracted between `---` delimiters
- `## Problem` and `### Evidence` sections extracted
- `### A{n}` answer blocks parsed (date, author, votes, accepted, body, comments)
- Must handle posts with no answers yet (newly created)

**`serializer.py`** — Serialize `StackPost` to markdown.
- Used by `lexi stack post` (initial creation) and `mutations.py` (appending)
- Frontmatter is always fully rewritten (mutable fields)
- Body is serialized in full — the serializer reconstructs from the model, but `mutations.py` handles append operations by parsing, modifying the model, and re-serializing

**`index.py`** — Build the stack index for CLI display and search.

```python
class StackIndex:
    @classmethod
    def build(cls, project_root: Path) -> StackIndex
        """Scan stack/ directory, parse frontmatter from each file."""

    def search(self, query: str) -> list[StackPost]
        """Full-text search across titles, problems, answers, tags."""

    def by_tag(self, tag: str) -> list[StackPost]
        """Filter posts by tag (case-insensitive)."""

    def by_scope(self, path: str) -> list[StackPost]
        """Filter posts by referenced file path (glob matching)."""

    def by_status(self, status: str) -> list[StackPost]
        """Filter posts by status."""

    def by_concept(self, concept: str) -> list[StackPost]
        """Filter posts referencing a specific concept."""
```

**`template.py`** — Template for `lexi stack post`.

```python
def render_post_template(
    post_id: str,
    title: str,
    tags: list[str],
    author: str,
    bead: str | None = None,
    refs_files: list[str] | None = None,
    refs_concepts: list[str] | None = None,
) -> str
```

**`mutations.py`** — State transitions and append operations.

```python
def add_answer(post_path: Path, author: str, body: str) -> StackPost
    """Append a new answer to an existing post."""

def record_vote(
    post_path: Path,
    target: str,       # "post" or "A{n}"
    direction: str,    # "up" or "down"
    author: str,
    comment: str | None = None,  # required for downvotes
) -> StackPost
    """Record a vote on a post or answer. Updates frontmatter vote count
    and appends comment with vote context if provided."""

def accept_answer(post_path: Path, answer_num: int) -> StackPost
    """Mark an answer as accepted. Sets status to resolved."""

def mark_duplicate(post_path: Path, duplicate_of: str) -> StackPost
    """Mark post as duplicate of another post."""

def mark_outdated(post_path: Path) -> StackPost
    """Mark post as outdated (referenced files changed)."""
```

## CLI Commands

### Command Group: `lexi stack`

```
lexi stack search <query> [--tag <t>] [--scope <path>] [--status <s>] [--concept <c>]
lexi stack post --title "..." [--tag ...] [--bead <id>] [--file ...] [--concept ...]
lexi stack answer <post-id> --body "..."
lexi stack vote <post-id> [--answer <n>] up|down [--comment "..."]
lexi stack accept <post-id> --answer <n>
lexi stack view <post-id>
lexi stack list [--status <s>] [--tag <t>]
```

### `lexi stack search <query>` — Search posts

Full-text search across titles, problem descriptions, answers, and tags. Returns a ranked compact list.

```
$ lexi stack search "timezone"
ST-001  [resolved] ▲3  Timezone-naive datetimes cause silent data corruption
  Tags: datetime, data-integrity | Refs: src/models/event.py, [[DateHandling]]

ST-015  [open]     ▲1  UTC conversion edge case in DST transitions
  Tags: datetime, timezone | Refs: src/utils/time.py

2 posts found
```

**Flags:**
- `--tag <tag>` — filter by tag
- `--scope <path>` — filter by referenced file path (glob matching)
- `--status <status>` — filter by status (default: all non-outdated)
- `--concept <concept>` — filter by referenced concept

### `lexi stack post` — Create a new post

Creates a new post with auto-assigned ID. Writes the template and outputs the file path.

```
$ lexi stack post --title "datetime.now() causes timezone corruption" \
    --tag datetime --tag data-integrity \
    --file src/models/event.py
Created .lexibrary/stack/ST-001-datetime-now-causes-timezone-corruption.md

Fill in the ## Problem and ### Evidence sections, then add an answer
with `lexi stack answer ST-001 --body "..."` when you have a solution.
```

The agent then writes the problem description directly into the file (or via stdin if we add that). Minimal required flags: `--title` and at least one `--tag`.

### `lexi stack answer <post-id>` — Add an answer

Appends a new answer block to an existing post.

```
$ lexi stack answer ST-001 --body "All datetime creation must go through utils/time.py:now()"
Added answer A1 to ST-001
```

### `lexi stack vote <post-id>` — Vote on a post or answer

Updates vote count in frontmatter. For answer votes, also updates the answer's vote count. Downvotes require `--comment`.

```
$ lexi stack vote ST-001 up
Upvoted ST-001 (now ▲4)

$ lexi stack vote ST-001 --answer 2 down --comment "This misses call sites"
Downvoted A2 on ST-001 (now ▼-1). Comment recorded.
```

### `lexi stack accept <post-id>` — Accept an answer

Marks an answer as accepted and sets post status to `resolved`.

```
$ lexi stack accept ST-001 --answer 1
Accepted A1 on ST-001. Status → resolved.
```

### `lexi stack view <post-id>` — View a post

Displays the full post content with formatting.

```
$ lexi stack view ST-001
# ST-001: Timezone-naive datetimes cause silent data corruption  [resolved] ▲3
Tags: datetime, data-integrity
Refs: src/models/event.py, [[DateHandling]]

### `lexi stack list` — Browse posts

```
$ lexi stack list
ST-001  [resolved] ▲3  Timezone-naive datetimes cause silent data corruption
ST-002  [open]     ▲0  Circular import between service modules
ST-003  [resolved] ▲5  Race condition in async payment processing

$ lexi stack list --status open
ST-002  [open]     ▲0  Circular import between service modules
```

---

## Unified Search: `lexi search`

The existing `lexi search` stub becomes the **cross-artifact search command**. It searches design files, concepts, and Stack posts in a single query and returns grouped results.

```
$ lexi search --tag auth
── Concepts ──
Authentication     — JWT-based auth with refresh token rotation
SessionManagement  — Server-side session handling for stateful flows

── Design Files ──
src/api/auth_controller.py  — Handles login/logout/refresh endpoints
src/middleware/jwt.py        — JWT validation middleware

── Stack ──
ST-007  [resolved] ▲4  Refresh token rotation breaks on clock skew
ST-012  [open]     ▲1  OAuth state parameter not validated

$ lexi search "timezone"
── Concepts ──
DateHandling  — UTC-everywhere convention for datetime handling

── Stack ──
ST-001  [resolved] ▲3  Timezone-naive datetimes cause silent data corruption
ST-015  [open]     ▲1  UTC conversion edge case in DST transitions
```

### Search Implementation

**Phase 6 (MVP):** File scanning. Parse YAML frontmatter from all artifacts for structured queries (tags, status, refs). Substring match on titles/summaries/bodies for text queries. Acceptable for < 500 total artifacts.

**Phase 10 (if needed):** SQLite index with full-text search. Schema designed from the start:

```sql
-- Unified search across all artifact types
CREATE TABLE artifacts (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- "concept:Auth", "design:src/foo.py", "stack:ST-001"
    artifact_type TEXT NOT NULL,   -- "concept", "design", "stack"
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    body_text TEXT,                -- searchable text content
    path TEXT NOT NULL             -- file path for retrieval
);

CREATE TABLE artifact_tags (
    artifact_id TEXT,
    tag TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (artifact_id, tag)
);

CREATE TABLE artifact_refs (
    artifact_id TEXT,
    ref_type TEXT,                 -- "concept", "file", "design"
    ref_target TEXT
);

-- Stack-specific tables
CREATE TABLE stack_answers (
    post_id TEXT,
    answer_num INTEGER,
    votes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    body_text TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (post_id, answer_num)
);

-- Full-text search across everything
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE artifacts_fts USING fts5(
    title, body_text, content='artifacts'
);
```

The key design principle: **`lexi search` uses the same interface regardless of backend.** The query API is stable; only the implementation changes from file scanning to SQLite.

---

## Cross-Linking

### Design files reference Stack posts

Design files gain a `## Stack` section (replacing `## Guardrails`):

```markdown
## Stack
- [[ST-001]] Timezone-naive datetimes — use `utils/time.py:now()`
- [[ST-015]] UTC conversion edge case — check boundary conditions
```

The `guardrail_refs` field in `DesignFile` model becomes `stack_refs`.

### Stack posts reference everything

Posts reference concepts, files, and designs via the `refs` frontmatter block. These references are bidirectional at query time — `lexi stack search --scope src/models/` finds posts that reference files under that path.

### Wikilink resolution

The Phase 5 wikilink resolver is extended to handle `ST-NNN` patterns:

```
Resolution order (updated):
1. Strip [[ and ]] brackets
2. Stack pattern check: /^ST-\d{3}/ → scan stack/ directory
3. Concept exact name match (case-sensitive)
4. Concept alias match (case-insensitive)
5. Concept fuzzy match
6. Return UnresolvedLink
```

### `.aindex` files

No change. `.aindex` files don't reference Stack posts.

---

## Staleness Detection

When `lexi validate` (Phase 7) runs, it checks each Stack post's `refs.files` against current source file hashes:

1. For each post, compute SHA-256 of every referenced source file
2. If any file has changed significantly since the post was created (or last verified), flag the post
3. Output: `⚠️ ST-001 may be outdated: src/models/event.py has changed since this post was created`

Agents encountering a flagged post either:
- Verify the solution still applies → update a `last_verified` frontmatter field
- Mark the post outdated → `lexi stack vote ST-001 outdated` (or status update via mutation)

---

## Agent Integration

### When to search The Stack

Agents should search before debugging or attempting a novel approach:

1. **On error** — search by error message or pattern
2. **Before architectural decisions** — search by concept or topic
3. **When design file has Stack refs** — follow the links
4. **When entering a directory** — if `.aindex` mentions relevant Stack posts

### When to create a post

The trigger question: **"Did this take me more than one attempt to solve?"** If yes, post it.

1. **After solving a non-trivial bug** — especially if it involved failed approaches
2. **After discovering a pitfall** — non-obvious constraints or gotchas
3. **After finding documentation was misleading** — correct the record
4. **After a failed approach** — even without a solution yet (open post)

### When to add an answer or comment

1. **Found a better solution** — add a new answer
2. **Existing answer worked** — upvote it
3. **Existing answer didn't work in context** — downvote with comment + optionally add alternative answer
4. **Need to add nuance** — comment on the relevant answer

### Agent environment rules (Phase 8 integration)

```
- Before debugging an unfamiliar error, run `lexi stack search "<error or topic>"`.
  If a post exists with an accepted answer, try that solution first.
- After solving a bug that took >1 attempt, run `lexi stack post` to record
  the problem and solution. Include evidence (test failures, error messages).
- After using a Stack post's solution successfully, run `lexi stack vote <id> up`.
- After finding a Stack post's solution doesn't work, run
  `lexi stack vote <id> --answer <n> down --comment "reason"` and optionally
  add a new answer with `lexi stack answer <id>`.
- When a design file has a `## Stack` section, read the referenced posts before
  modifying the file.
```

### Hooks and automation

**Design file cross-linking:** When `lexi update` generates/refreshes a design file, scan Stack post `refs.files` for matches and auto-populate the `## Stack` section. This is a Phase 7+ enhancement — for Phase 6 MVP, cross-links are manual.

**Post-commit suggestion:** After a commit that changes test status (failures → passing), the agent environment rules suggest creating a Stack post. This is a soft prompt in the rules, not an automated hook.

**Staleness flagging:** `lexi validate` checks referenced file hashes and flags outdated posts. This runs during Phase 7 validation.

---

## Changes to Existing Code

### `artifacts/design_file.py`

Rename `guardrail_refs: list[str]` → `stack_refs: list[str]`.

### `artifacts/design_file_serializer.py`

Rename `## Guardrails` section → `## Stack`. Update serialization to use new field name.

### `artifacts/design_file_parser.py`

Update parser to recognize `## Stack` section (and `## Guardrails` for backward compatibility during transition).

### `wiki/resolver.py`

Extend resolution order: add `ST-NNN` pattern detection before concept lookup. Route to `.lexibrary/stack/ST-NNN-*.md` using glob matching.

### `cli.py`

- Replace `guardrail_app` and `guardrails` command with `stack_app` and `stack` sub-commands
- Implement `stack search`, `stack post`, `stack answer`, `stack vote`, `stack accept`, `stack view`, `stack list`
- Update `lexi search` stub to become unified cross-artifact search

### `init/scaffolder.py`

Replace `guardrails/` directory creation with `stack/` in the skeleton.

1. Rename `guardrail_refs` → `stack_refs` in `DesignFile` model
2. Update `design_file_serializer.py`: `## Guardrails` → `## Stack`
3. Update `design_file_parser.py`: recognize both `## Stack` and `## Guardrails` (backward compat)
4. Update any BAML prompts that reference guardrails
5. Write tests for updated serializer/parser

### Task Group 6: Wikilink Resolver Update

1. Update `wiki/resolver.py` to recognize `ST-NNN` pattern (replacing `GR-NNN`)
2. Route `[[ST-001]]` to `.lexibrary/stack/ST-001-*.md` via glob
3. Update resolver tests

### Task Group 7: Unified Search (Phase 7 prep)

1. Update `lexi search` command to query across concepts (via `ConceptIndex`), design files (via frontmatter scan), and Stack posts (via `StackIndex`)
2. Group and format results by artifact type
3. Support `--tag`, `--scope`, and free-text query across all types
4. Write integration tests for cross-artifact search

### Task Group 8: Init & Scaffolding Update

1. Update `init/scaffolder.py`: `guardrails/` → `stack/`
2. Update config schema if any guardrail-specific config exists
3. Update blueprint/design files for renamed modules

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `lexi stack post --title "..." --tag ...` creates a valid post file with auto-assigned ID
2. `lexi stack answer ST-001 --body "..."` appends a new answer block to an existing post
3. `lexi stack vote ST-001 up` increments the post vote count
4. `lexi stack vote ST-001 --answer 1 down --comment "reason"` decrements A1 votes and appends comment with `[downvote]` context
5. `lexi stack vote <id> down` without `--comment` produces an error
6. `lexi stack accept ST-001 --answer 1` marks A1 accepted and post status → resolved
7. `lexi stack search "timezone"` returns matching posts ranked by relevance
8. `lexi stack search --tag datetime` filters by tag
9. `lexi stack search --scope src/models/` filters by referenced file path
10. `lexi search --tag auth` returns results from concepts, design files, AND Stack posts
11. Design files use `## Stack` section with `[[ST-NNN]]` references
12. Wikilink resolver correctly handles `[[ST-001]]` → `.lexibrary/stack/ST-001-*.md`
13. All new code has `from __future__ import annotations`
14. All output uses `rich.console.Console` — no bare `print()`
15. Test coverage for all new modules

## What to Watch Out For

- **ID assignment must be atomic** — scan existing `ST-NNN` files to find the next available ID. Handle concurrent creation gracefully (unlikely with single-agent sessions, but design for it).
- **Append-only body means parse-modify-serialize** — when adding an answer, parse the full post, append to the answers list, and re-serialize. Don't do string concatenation on the raw file — it's fragile and risks corrupting existing content.
- **Frontmatter vote counts can drift** — if an agent edits the file directly and changes a vote count without recording a comment, the count and the comment trail diverge. Accept this as a soft constraint — git history is the audit trail.
- **The `## Guardrails` → `## Stack` rename in design files** — existing design files generated by Phase 4 have `## Guardrails`. The parser must handle both section names during the transition. No bulk migration needed — files are updated naturally as `lexi update` runs.
- **Unified search performance** — scanning all three artifact types for every query is O(concepts + design_files + stack_posts). For MVP this is fine. Phase 10 SQLite index eliminates this if it becomes slow.
- **Post slugs in filenames** — the slug is derived from the title, truncated to ~50 chars, lowercased, hyphenated. Used for human readability in file listings. The `id` field in frontmatter is the canonical identifier, not the filename.
- **Tag namespace collision** — tags are shared across concepts, design files, and Stack posts. This is intentional (enables unified search) but means tag conventions should be documented. A tag like `auth` should mean the same thing whether it's on a concept or a Stack post.

## Features Deferred

- **Hot/trending ranking** — rank posts by recent vote activity. Nice-to-have, not MVP.
- **Auto-search on error** — hook that automatically searches The Stack when an agent hits a test failure. Requires daemon integration (Phase 9).
- **Post templates by category** — different templates for bug reports, patterns, decisions. MVP uses a single template.
- **Merge posts** — combine duplicate posts. For now, mark as duplicate with pointer.
- **Post verification workflow** — periodic prompt for agents to verify flagged posts. For now, `lexi validate` flags them and agents handle ad hoc.

---

## Not In Scope

- **Graph traversal** — "What posts are 2 hops from this concept?" is a Phase 10 concern.
- **Reputation system** — all agent sessions are treated equally. No karma or badges.
- **Post editing** — body is append-only. Corrections come as new answers or comments, not edits.
- **Notification system** — no mechanism to alert agents about new answers to their posts. Agents discover updates via search.
- **LLM-generated posts** — posts are agent/human authored. No automated post creation.
