    """Run all validation checks and return an aggregated report.

    Runs the registered checks, aggregates their issues into a single
    ``ValidationReport``, and optionally filters by severity or check name.

    Args:
        project_root: Root directory of the project.
        lexibrary_dir: Path to the .lexibrary directory.
        severity_filter: Only include checks at this severity level or above.
            Valid values: ``"error"`` (errors only), ``"warning"`` (errors +
            warnings), ``"info"`` (all -- the default when ``None``).
        check_filter: Run only the named check. Must be a key in
            ``AVAILABLE_CHECKS``. When ``None``, all checks are run.

    Returns:
        A ValidationReport with all discovered issues.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``check_filter`` names an unknown check or
            ``severity_filter`` is not a valid severity level.
