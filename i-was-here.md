# I was here

These files are created by agents after they have created/midified files in a directory and have left something unfinished or something that they want to warn the next agent about. They are supposed to be ephemeral and deleted after the next agent has read them.

# What they are not:
 - A learning of something that needs to be passed down to all child agents.
 - A failure mode that has been tested and doesn't need to be tried again.
 - A new global or local convention that needs to be followed.
